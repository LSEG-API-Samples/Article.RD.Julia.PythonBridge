# Article.RD.Julia.PythonBridge
With its user-friendly syntax and impressive performance, Julia is steadily gaining recognition and is proving to be a noteworthy alternative in the field for data scientists. Julia has been gaining popularity for its speed and user-friendly syntax. As of 2021, Julia had been downloaded over 40 million times, indicating a growing interest in the language. One of Julia’s key strengths is its speed, comparable to languages like C and Fortran. This makes Julia particularly useful for high-performance computing. In this article, we explore how to use Python packages in Julia, focusing on retrieving company financial data within the Jupyter environment. We’ll demonstrate how Julia and Python can work together to perform sophisticated data analysis tasks.
